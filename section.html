                        Our team have been working hard this year, and we are really looking forward to making some exciting announcements in the new year, which we think...

                        Raw vegetables will be more than fine for most but, again similar to giving them apples, consider cutting anything up into smaller more manageable sizes depending on the size of your dog…and just how quickly they try to eat everything in sight!
                    </p>
            <h1 id="3" class="chp">Chapter3</h1>

                        Not only is it a good source of protein (for us and them), it’s also full of all the good stuff that our dogs need. Just be 100% sure you don’t give your dog a version with additives, sugar, salt, artificial sweeteners etc.
                    </p>
            <h1 id="4" class="chp">Chapter4</h1>

                        We all know our doggie friends love juicy meat dishes, and as a treat this is more than suitable as a good treat.

Just remember, lean meats generally mean chicken, fish and red meat. All of this should be unseasoned, without any sauces or spices, and cut into manageable pieces as usual. Always avoid processed meats like bacon, sausage, chorizo etc.

No matter how much they whine!

                        At Pet Bakery we focus on making delicious dog treats from 100% natural ingredients. Every treat is handmade here in the UK, and every treat is doggo-approved with natural quality ingredients and none of the bad stuff.

From our Cheeky Cheese Paws, to our Luxury Liver Brownies, to our Sunday Roast, and everything else in between. You can even see the exact ingredients on each product page (and our packaging) meaning you know exactly what you’re feeding your dog!
